           The Havanese, a bichon-type dog, is the national dog of Cuba, developed from the now extinct <i>Blanquito de la Habana</i>  
        ("little white dog of Havana").

        <i>Activities:</i>  
       <br>
       Because of the Havanese's friendly and readily trained nature, it is used for a variety of jobs involving the public,
        including therapy dogs, assistance dogs, such as signal dogs for the hearing impaired, performing dogs, mold and termite
         detection, and tracking.
       Havanese also compete in a variety of dog sports, such as dog agility, musical canine freestyle, and obedience
        training.
       <br>
   The Havanese has moderate exercise needs. They will benefit from a brisk daily walk or a fun playtime with their owner in the
    backyard,
      as they are happiest when someone is with them. Romping inside the home can also provide enough activity. Never over-exercise
       a Havanese of any age.
       If they are panting and struggling to keep up, it is time to go home.
      Havanese do well in both houses and apartments, but they are not happy left alone for hours at a time although you will still be 
      greeted by a happy dog.</p>

        <i>Vaccines and other</i> <br>
        When you get a dog, you have to be prepared for many trips to the vet, just like having a baby. In the first few months,
         dogs must receive many vaccines, for example against: puppy distemper, canine adenovirus (infectious hepatitis),
          parainfluenza virus (infectious dog cough)...
You should also know that they should receive a rabies vaccine every year. Although every veterinarian should inform you.
